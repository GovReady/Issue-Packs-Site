      <h4>How To Create An Issue Pack</h4>
      <p>Issue Packs are simple <a href="http://yaml.org/" target="_blank">YAML</a> files that use the <a href="https://github.com/govready/issue-packs#issue-pack-format--yaml-" target="_blank">Issue Pack YAML Format.</a>  To create a new Issue Pack, simply open a text file with your favorite text editor and set up the pack name, issues, and issue labels as described in the <a href="https://github.com/govready/issue-packs#issue-pack-format--yaml-" target="_blank">Issue Pack Format</a> section of the library's README.  You're then free to upload your packs to <a v-link="{ name: 'my-packs' }">your packs page</a> and sync to any of your linked accounts.</p>
