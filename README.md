# Issue-Packs-Site
Issue Pack marketplace for [issue-pack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/issue-pack)

## Issue Packs

The issue packs on the site currently pull from [the issue-pack examples directory](https://github.com/GovReady/Issue-Packs/tree/master/examples).

_Users can also upload issue packs of their own, but they are currently only used as a sync tool and are not stored on the site._
